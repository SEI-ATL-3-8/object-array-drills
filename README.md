# Object and Array drills

## Setup
Create an html file and link `exercises.js` to it. Open the html file in Chrome, and confirm that the linkage was successful.

## Drills!
Make your way through `exercises.js`, answering the prompts. Note that the answers are all in `answers.js`! This point of this deliverable is not to just get the answers, the point is to work through the exercises yourself and use the answers as training wheels while you build your understanding.
